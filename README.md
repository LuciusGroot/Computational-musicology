computational musicology
Dear Reader,

LuciusGrootHomeworkweek7 is the homework assignment of week 7.

I am interested in how spotify will react to a sudden change in music. I do not listen to the same songs as I used to listen when I was between the age of 2 and 12. I decided that I will only listen to those songs again and see how spotify will react. Spotify does not know that I used to listen to these songs (I listened to them on CD and some songs are DVD's intros or soundtracks). This is also why I think it is interesting.
I begin listening more and more to musical theatre songs on spotify since 2017, but I do not really like disney songs. I want to know which songs spotify will recommend me. 
I would also like to know which code I can use for this, but I will hopefully learn that during this course.
I can also see how my music taste has changed and compare it, which I find interesting to see.

Kind regards, Lucius Groot
